#### Project Description

Kariveppila Reviews is a visually stunning, modern movie review website built with a static HTML/CSS frontend and a Python backend. It's designed to look incredible while providing reviews that are... creatively unhelpful. It's the perfect blend of over-engineered design and under-engineered content.

The internet is absolutely saturated with high-quality, insightful, and well-researched movie reviews. It's overwhelming\! Where can a person go to find a review site that has all the visual flair of a blockbuster but the substance of a B-movie plot hole?

Kariveppila Reviews, We solve the "problem" of useful criticism by focusing all our energy on gradient backgrounds, hover animations, and intricate SVG art. You get the full cinematic experience of a website without the burden of a coherent opinion.
